There's a frequently asked question thing in work. Will be ready when the game is coming out.

$0 budget, spare time, and less than 3 active contributors kinda make things hard :) But if you like you can spend some money through the website DONATE paypal thing.


I wish you much fun trying out this pre-alpha and if I have some time for it I will setup a test server for the pre-alpha.

Thanks.
